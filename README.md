## Santandar Statement Parser

This app reads PDF files and parses specific elements. In this instance it's used to take Santandar statements extracting the account number and date.
The result is then used to rename the files so that they can be stored in a more useful way than the default name when downloaded. If only Santandar
just names the statement appropriately in the first place!
